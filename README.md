# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
V. Isualize, the CEO of Pyber, a ridesharing company, has asked our team to create a summary DataFrame from the ride-sharing data set and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, rider_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib
## Results 
Our results from the DataFrame and the multiple-line graph show that the urban data dominates the Pyber dataset. 
### Fares vs. City Types
Per the below image we can see that for the months of January-April the weekly fares were highest for the urban city type. The highest peaks in fees for each city type were a few weeks at the end of February, the beginning of March, and the beginning of April.

Based on both the city and ride data set we saw the urban fares account for about 63% of the fares in 2019 with suburban fares amounting to approximately 31% of fares.

### Ride vs. City
Similar to the Fare vs. City Type analysis we saw that the urban city-type took up the majority of the ride count per city. Per the below image we can see the urban city type and suburban city type make up approximately 68% and 26% of the total rides respectively.

### Drivers vs. City Type
Looking at the complete data set for the ride data and city data we saw similar results when we compared the percentage of drivers for each city type. Per the below image we can see that approximately 81% of the drivers are for urban city types with the suburban and rural city types making up less than 20% of the drivers.

There seems to be a large disparity in the number of urban and suburban drivers compared to the Fare vs. City Type and Ride vs. City Type analyses. With the above two analyses, we saw the urban City Type comprised approximately 65% of the data but the driver data shows an approximate 20% increase from what would be expected of the urban city type. Similarly, the suburban city type comprised approximately 30% of the fare and ride data but the driver data shows a 15% decrease in what would be expected of the suburban city type.

## Summary
As the above analysis shows there is a large disparity between the urban data and the suburban and rural data. As mentioned above in the Drivers vs. City Type analysis, there is a disparity in the driver count between Suburban and Urban drivers. Our teamâ€™s suggestion would be to add an incentive for drivers in suburban and rural city types and to increase the number of drivers for each city type. Additionally, to handle fare disparity it is our teams suggestion that urban city fares increase so that suburban and rural area fares can be decreased. Lastly, we suggestions looking into the demand and wait times for rides by city type to see if adding more drivers or increasing the fares for those city types would be beneficial.
